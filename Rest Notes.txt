REST Framework works on three basic principle
1. Resource - Object in our application like products, cart, collection. We can identify the resource using URLs.
    http://localhost:3000/products
    http://localhost:3000/products/1
    http://localhost:3000/products/1/reviews
    http://localhost:3000/products/1/reviews/1

2. Representation: How we represent our resource to client.
    HTML, XML or JSON
    In server, we represent resources by objects

3. HTTP Methods
   They help in telling the server what to do with the resource
   GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
   PUT vs PATCH, if we want to update all the properties(PUT) or subset of property
